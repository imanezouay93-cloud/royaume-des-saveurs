# Public Assets Documentation

This directory contains public assets for the Next.js application. You can place images, fonts, and other static files here that can be accessed directly via the URL.

## Usage

- All files in this directory can be accessed at the root of your application.
- For example, if you place an image named `logo.png` in this directory, it can be accessed at `/logo.png`.

## Best Practices

- Organize your assets in subdirectories if necessary.
- Use descriptive names for your files to make them easier to identify.
- Optimize images and other assets for web use to improve loading times.
